Odin Project: Landing Page

This project aims to have me create a web page based off the design given.
As a gentle reminder to myself this does not need to be pixel perfect this project is more about creating something from scratch.

Update 1: So I managed to patch together a very ugly barebones html code that resembles the example. Now I need to 
use CSS and make it look pleasing and not something  that makes my eye bleed.
