Odin Project: Landing Page

This project aims to have me create a web page based off the design given.
As a gentle reminder to myself this does not need to be pixel perfect this project is more about creating something from scratch.

Update #1: Added a bunch of images and renamed them to have the authors name intact for credit of image.

Update 2: I've coded and styled the upper header bar. I think for I'm going to break it down in chunks and work through each one.
